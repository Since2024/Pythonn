#Function are code blocks that can be reused that you can call or to bring in action
#def pin(): #def means define a function, (invoke =action) : means the start of the function
 #   print(message) message which is variable is now argument
#pin() #IS INVOKED AT END TO RUN CODE


# string = "hasan gaha"
# print(string[4])
#  indexing starts at 0, this start from front is positive integers.
#to access from last string charcter we can use -1 to -n


#to get total number of charcaters in string we use builtin function len(variables name)
# air = "hawa"
# print(len(air))

#built in function type(V.N) which returns data type of variable
# air = "hawa"
# water = 100
# print(type(air), type(water))
