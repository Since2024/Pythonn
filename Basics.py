#message = "Don't move"
#print(pin)


#Function are code blocks that can be reused that you can call or to bring in action
#def pin(): #def means define a function, (invoke =action) : means the start of the function
 #   print(message) message which is variable is now argument
#pin() #IS INVOKED AT END TO RUN CODE


# string = "hasan gaha"
# print(string[4])
#  indexing starts at 0, this start from front is positive integers.
#to access from last string charcter we can use -1 to -n


#to get total number of charcaters in string we use builtin function len(variables name)
# air = "hawa"
# print(len(air))

#built in function type(V.N) which returns data type of variable
# air = "hawa"
# water = 100
# print(type(air), type(water))


#method is similar to function but it is used with object
#alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
#alphabet.find('z') output ayena cause vscode is not interactive shell to automatically show output
# print(alphabet.find('z')) #find method is used to find the index

# Method is similiar to function that is tied to object and class
# alphabet = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" 
# text = "Zaltan" i am using this variable to find position of alphabet strings
# index = print(alphabet.find(text[3])) method find is assigned to index to find text[3] which is t from aphabets.

#.find() returns the index of matching character inside  string if not find return -1
# text = "Zaltan"
# print(text.lower()) #this will covert string to lower case
# index = print(alphabet.find(text[0].lower())) inside we can call like this too

# shifted = alphabet[index] this is store the output of index in shifted variable
